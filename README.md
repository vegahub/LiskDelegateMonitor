# LiskDelegateMonitor
AHK script to remotely monitor your Lisk Delegate node.


Description

This is an AHK script that allows Windows users to remotely monitor their delegate nodes status and health, as well as the Lisk networks.

Installation

You only need to install Autohotkey, and run delegatemonitor.ahk.
You'll need Notify.ahk in the same folder. It's included here or you can download it from: http://www.gwarble.com/ahk/Notify/

Alternatively you can download delegatemonitor.exe and run it without any dependencies.

After the first start a settings.ini will be generated. Please edit this file and add your own settings.
